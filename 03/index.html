    		<p class="short-bio">DJ Rashad and his production partner DJ Spinn have gone from regional lynchpins to de facto international ambassadors for footwork—the Chicago-centric offshoot of juke that piles frantic samples on top of bottomless basslines at breakneck speed—and helped to alter the way people think about dance music north of 140 BPM. He has been one of footwork's most fearless innovators—while the rest of the world has been absorbing the style, DJ Rashad made a lateral move away from its cliches, taking in new sounds on his frequent travels. Despite being so closely associated with one genre, DJ Rashad was an adventurous soul, greedily absorbing new influences and ideas and helping to redefine what footwork can sound like in the process.
